# Spiking vs Non-Spiking Residual Denoising

A controlled comparison between a spiking neural network (SNN) and
topologically matched non-spiking (ANN) residual denoisers, across two
modalities (MNIST, SpeechCommands), with a real Poisson diffusion process
for audio, a MAC/AC-based energy estimate, and a set of ablations
(noise-process choice, baseline architecture strength) rather than a
single uncontested comparison.

## Overview

**Image branch (MNIST):** standard Gaussian diffusion forward process;
the network predicts the added noise (epsilon-prediction).

**Audio branch (SpeechCommands):** a genuine Poisson thinning diffusion
process (`src/diffusion_audio_poisson.py`) with a real forward transition
`q(x_t | x_{t-1})`, derived from the Poisson thinning/superposition
theorems, a closed-form marginal `q(x_t | x_0)` used for efficient
training, and a reverse ancestral sampler that can generate audio from
pure noise — making this branch a genuine generative model, not only a
single-shot denoiser. The forward-chain vs. closed-form consistency is
numerically verified in `scripts/verify_poisson_diffusion.py`.

Both branches condition the network on the diffusion timestep and use
matched spiking/non-spiking block topology, so the only architectural
difference is the neuron model.

**Headline result:** *pending a full training run — see [Usage](#usage).*

See [`REPORT.md`](REPORT.md) for the full write-up: methodology, the
Poisson-diffusion derivation and its numerical verification, the energy
analysis methodology, ablation protocols, and honestly-reported
limitations.

## What's New in v2

Building on the fixed-bug v1 (paired evaluation, on-distribution
sparsity/latency), this version adds:

| Addition | What it does | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Real Poisson diffusion** | Proper `q(x_t\|x_{t-1})` forward chain + closed-form marginal + reverse ancestral sampler, derived from the Poisson thinning theorem | `src/diffusion_audio_poisson.py` |
| **Energy analysis** | Per-layer MAC/AC counting via forward hooks, converted to an energy estimate using cited literature per-op costs (Horowitz 2014). A first version applied AC pricing uniformly and got a real Colab run *wrong* (-247% "savings"); now fixed to inspect each layer's actual input and only price genuine spike-fed layers as AC — see REPORT.md §4 | `src/energy.py` |
| **Noise-process ablation** | Same architecture trained under Poisson / Gaussian / Bernoulli corruption, compared empirically | `src/diffusion_audio_{gaussian,bernoulli}.py`, `scripts/run_noise_ablation.py` |
| **Temporal denoising viz** | Denoising behavior shown across `t = 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 39` | `src/visualize.py::plot_temporal_denoising` |
| **Stronger ANN baselines** | 1D U-Net, dilated (WaveNet-style) CNN, Residual TCN, in addition to the matched-topology baseline | `src/models_audio_baselines.py`, `scripts/run_baseline_comparison.py` |
| **Adaptive-step spiking block** | ACT-style (Graves 2016) learned per-sample halting — a step towards event-driven computation, explicitly *not* claimed to be a full continuous-time ODE-SNN | `src/models_audio_adaptive.py` |
| **Multi-seed runner** | Aggregates mean ± std across seeds, saves incrementally per-seed (Colab-disconnect-safe) | `scripts/run_multiseed.py` |

## Architecture

- **Spiking residual block** — Conv → GroupNorm → LIF neuron (surrogate
  gradient, `fast_sigmoid`), unrolled over `N` internal timesteps and
  rate-averaged, with a skip connection.
- **Non-spiking residual block** — identical topology with SiLU instead
  of LIF; single forward pass.
- **Adaptive spiking block** (`models_audio_adaptive.py`) — same LIF core,
  but a learned halting unit lets each sample use fewer internal steps.
- **Strong ANN baselines** (`models_audio_baselines.py`) — 1D U-Net
  (encoder/decoder + skips), dilated WaveNet-style stack, and a Residual
  TCN (Bai et al., 2018 style), all matched on time-conditioning.

## Results

for the reporting template this table will follow, including the
noise-ablation and baseline-comparison tables.*

## Bugs Found & Fixed on the First Real (Colab) Run

Running the smoke test on an actual T4 GPU surfaced two real bugs the
sandbox-only testing here couldn't have caught:

1. **Energy accounting bug** — the first energy estimate applied one
   overall spike rate uniformly to every layer, including layers that
   never actually see a spike, and charged non-firing elements at full
   MAC price instead of the zero cost event-driven hardware gives them.
   This produced a nonsensical **-247% "energy savings"** (spiking model
   costing *more*). Fixed to inspect each layer's real input tensor and
   price strictly by measured per-layer activity. Full derivation and
   before/after numbers in `REPORT.md` §4.
2. **NaN latency bug** — `measure_time` requested more warmup+timing
   batches than a small `--audio-subset-size` smoke test's test split
   contained, silently producing `nan±nan` instead of a real number.
   Fixed by cycling the test loader. Details in `REPORT.md` §4.1.

Both are fixed in this version and were re-verified with targeted tests
before being pushed (see conversation / commit history).

## Limitations

See [`REPORT.md`](REPORT.md) Section 7 for the full list. Headline items:
- No results populated yet — every quantitative claim is pending an
  actual run.
- The adaptive spiking block is an ACT-style discrete approximation to
  event-driven computation, not a full continuous-time ODE-SNN.
- The energy estimate uses literature per-operation costs (Horowitz 2014,
  45nm CMOS), not a measurement on real neuromorphic hardware.
- Poisson thinning diffusion for audio is a novel construction for this
  project (derived from standard point-process theorems), not an
  implementation of a specific published paper — treat it as such when
  citing.
